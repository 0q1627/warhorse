# Requirements
To run Warhorse you need a few things before you attempt to deploy your infrastruture.

## 1. Domain Name
You will need to buy a domain name. For our use case the name does not really matter. I would recommend that you only use this domain for warhorse but it it possable to reuse your domain name. There are lots of great places to buy a domain name, one good one is https://porkbun.com/

## 2. Cloud Provider
You will need to use a cloud provider and more importenly you will need API keys. You will only need API keys for the services you plan to use.

### AWS

AWSCLI 

API Key

### Digital Ocean

API Key

### Azure

AZ CLI

## 3. Secrets Manager (optional)

## 4. State File (optional)
